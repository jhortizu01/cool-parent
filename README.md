## Abstract
[Cool Parents Deployed Web App](https://cool-parent.herokuapp.com/)

Finding friends as an adult is hard. Find friends as a parent is harder. Meet Cool Parents. If Tinder and PBS Kids had a baby it would be Cool Parents. This web app is for parents to find other parents to be friends with. We are assuming you are loggin in as a user. On the main page shows you a list of possible new friends. Each friend card gives you details about another user such as their occupation, favorite activities and a short description about themselves. The user has the ability to click on the fist bump to make another user their friend. If the user wants to view their friends they would view all of their friends on their friend tab. To unfriend a friend, the user would simply just click on the fist bump icon again, which also removes their friend from their friend list. There is also an events tab to see what events others are holding with an option to input your own event.
